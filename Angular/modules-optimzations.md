# What are modules?
Angular modules - NgModule, like the app module or the app routing module.
Ways of bundling Angular building blocks together - components, directives, services, pipes.
We need to group them together so Angular is aware of these features. Angular doesn't automatically scan all the files in our project.
Every Angular app has to have at least one module, the app module.

Angular analyzes NgModule to "understand" our app and its features.
Angular modules define all the building blocks: components, directives, services, etc.
An app requires at least one module, but can be split into multiple modules.
Core Angular features are included in Angular modules (e.g. FormsModule) to lead them only when we need.
We can't user any feature of building block without including it in a module.

# analyzing the AppModule
So far in the recipes app we have the app.module.ts and the app-routing.module.ts. They both have the @ngModule decorator.

- declarations is an array of all the components, directives, and custom pipes we're using. We have to declare them or we can't use them in the app.
- imports - allows us to import other modules into this module
We use a few modules that ship with Angular (FormsModule, HttpClientModule), and our own AppRoutingModule
For example, the FormsModule has a declarations array with all the directives we use with forms. 
- providers - we list all the services we want to provide; any service we plan on injecting needs to be listed here (or, the alternative is to use the @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'}) in the component where we want to use it.)
- bootstrap - important for starting our app; it defines which component is available right in the index.html file. We typically have one root component.
- entryComponent - when we're creating components programmatically

The app-routing module holds the route configuration. We could put all the routes in the app.module, but we want to keep the app module a bit leaner. 
The app-routing module imports the RouterModule from Angular and uses the forRoot method. Then we export the RouterModule from the app-routing module.
Every module works on its own.
We need export the app-routing module so we can then import it into the app module. Otherwise it would only be available in the app-routing module.
When we import a module we import everything that module exports.

The bigger our application grows, the more likely we'll want to split it up into separate modules. This can also help with performance. 

# Getting started with Feature Modules
Feature module - grouping together the parts of the app that are used together in a certain area of the app.
Example: ProductsModule with ProductsListComponet and ProductComponent, plus an OrdersModule with OrdersComponent and HighlightDirective

In the reipces app, Max divides it into Recipes, ShoppingList, and Auth.
There's also the header and the shared folder.

In the recipes folder, we create a recipes.module.ts
We export a class and name it RecipesModule {}
The class needs @NgModule as a decorator (imported from @angular/core)
The @NgModule decorator takes an object that we pass into configure that module, and then we can add what we had previously put in the app module.
@ngModule({})
We'll include a declarations array and add all the recipe-related components. 
We remove them from the app module and put them in the recipes module.
declarations: [
    RecipeComponent,
    RecipeListComponent, etc.
]

We can also remove the unused import statements. We don't need to import the types into the app module anymore. But we do need to import them into the recipes module.

Then we need to add the exports array and add all the components to that array, so they will also be available to any module that imports this module.

In the app.module.ts we add RecipesModule to the imports array there. (And also add the import statement at the top: import { RecipesModule } from './file-path';)
The imports array in @NgModule is there for Angular to add features of other modules into this module. The import at the top of the file is a TypeScript feature to tell TS where to find the type.

If we try to compile at that point we'll get an error: 'router-outlet' is not a known element. We're using 'router-outlet' in the RecipesComponent.
The RouterModule is imported into the app-routing module in order to configure our routes and add routing features, like the RouterLink directive and the router-outlet directive.
We export it in the exports array here in app-routing.module.ts, and it is imported into the app module. However, it won't automatically be available in the recipes module.
Everything in a module stands alone.
The recipes module and the components there have no access to all the things we import into the app module. (The routing module, the forms module, etc.)

# Splitting modules correctly
One way to fix that error is to import the RouterModule (without .forRoot()) in the imports array of the recipes module.

Before now everything was getting access to every feature from the app module. 
ngIf and ngFor are provided by the browser modules, form directives by the forms module, etc.
[the http client module works differently becuase it only provides services and those are available application-wide]

One special case: the BrowserModule must only be used once in the app module. It does general application startup that only runs once.
In order to get access to ngIf and ngFor, etc in other modules, we import the CommonModule. (and import that from '@angular/common')

We also need to import the ReactiveFormsModule into the RecipesModule.

Then everything should be running as before.

# Adding routes to feature modules
We can move the recipes-related route configuration away from the app-routing module and into the recipes module.
In the imports of the recipes.module.ts, we can add .forChild() to the RouterModule.
.forRoot() is only used once in the app-routing module.
In a feature module which we plan on importing into the app module, we use .forChild() which will automatically merge the child routing configuration with the root routes. Then we can pass in the same array of route configurations we passed to .forRoot().
To keep the file leaner, we can create a separate recipes-routing.module.ts file.
We can declare the routes, const routes: Routes = [], then we cut the recipes route from the app-routing module and paste it in here. Then everything would need to be imported at the top of the recipes-routing file (components, authguard, etc).

Then in the @NgModule, in the imports we list RouteModule (which also needs to be imported from @angular/router) we can use .forChild(routes) and then pass in the routes.
We also need to export the RouterModule. 
Then in the recipes module we import the RecipesRoutingModule

And since we import the RecipesModule into the app module, we should stil have the routes in the recipes routing file as part of the general routes configuration.

# Component Declarations
In the routes, we have the RecipesComponent loading whenever we visit /recipes.
The RecipesComponent is also declared in the RecipesModule.
We have to add all the components to the declarations - whether we're going to load them via the routing or a template.

If we define which components should be loaded for which route, we don't need to export them in the recipes module. We're only using them internally in the recipes module. We have them either embedded into other components or are loading them through the recipes routing.

# The ShoppingList feature module
We don't have to have a separate shopping-list routing file. We can just put that in the shopping-list.module.ts file:

imports: [
    RouterModuel.forChild([
        { path: 'shopping-list', component: ShoppingListComponent },
    ])
]

We also need to import the CommonModule and the FormsModule.

Then in the app.module we need to import the ShoppingListModule

# Understanding Shared Modules
If we have two feature modules that use a lot of the same things, we can avoid code duplication and have leander modules.
We can put shared features (components, directives, etc) into a shared module and then import that module into both the other feature modules.

We can have multiple shared modules, so we can name that by which features we're grouping together, but if we just have the one it can be shared.module.ts
We'll declare the AlertComponent, the LoadingSpinnerComponent, the PlaceholderDirective, and the DropdownDirective.
We'll import the CommonModule and export all the components, directives, and the common module.
Then wherever we import the shared module, we have access to all these features that we initialize here.

Then in the shoppinglist module we can replace common module with the shared module.
It's not super helpful in this example because we just replace one module with another; but if we wanted to use the alert or the dropdown in the shopping list module, we'd gain a lot more from that.

We can do the same thing in the recipes module.

Keeping this just as it is, we get an error saying that the DropdownDirective is part of the declarations of two modules: SharedModule and AppModule.
This is an important concept: we can only define or declare components, directives, and pipes once. We can import a module into multiple imports. 

So in the app module we need to remove from the declarations all the components and directives we declared in the shared module.
Also we need to cut entryComponents from app module and add it shared module.
Then we import the shared module to the app module.
