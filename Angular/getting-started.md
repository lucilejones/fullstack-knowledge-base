Angular is a JS framework that allows us to create reactive single-page-applications.

SPA: all the changes are rendered in the browser; it's actually one HTML page. JS is much fater than having to reach out to a server for every page change and data update. JS changes the DOM during runtime. 

# VERSIONS
AngularJS (Angular 1) - there were some flaws
Angular 2 - completely rewritten; a totally different framework
There have been several updated versions. They're all the same framework (starting with Angular 2). Angular is pretty backward compatible.
