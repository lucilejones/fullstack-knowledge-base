# intro
Beacuse we're building single page applications, we need to handle forms through Angular. Then if we want to submit something to a server, we have to reach out via Angular's http service (which we'll cover later in the course).

Angular will parse the info given by the user and also check validation. We'll need an object representation in our TS code of the user's inputs. 
And Angular gives us this - a JS object representation of our form, which makes it simple to retrieve user values, see the state of the form, and work with it.

# Template-driven vs. Reactive approach
Angular offers two approaches
Template-driven: set up the form in the template, in the HTML code, and Angular will automatically infer the structure of the form, which controls the form has, which inputs, etc, and that makes it easier to get started quickly.
Angular infers the form object from the DOM.

Reactive approach: We define the structure of the form in TS code, also set up the html code, and manually connect it. This gives us greater control.
The form is created programmatically and synchronized with the DOM.

# An example form
We don't put an action or method attribute on the fom tag in the html because we don't want an http request to be the result of submitting this form. We don't want it sent to a server - we want Angular to handle the form.

# creating the form and registering the controls
We need to make sure, in the app module, to add FormsModule to the imports array and import it at the top of the file from '@angular/forms';
With this imported, Angular will automatically create a form for us (a JS representation of the form) when it detects a form element in the HTML code. 
We can think of the form element serving as a selector for an Angular directive which then creates a JS representation of the form. We don't immediately see the JS object. If we could it would be empty because Angular does not automatically detect the inputs in our form. We might not want to add all of these elements as controls in our form. (Controls, meaning what is in the JS object). We still need to register controls manually and let Angular know which elements should be controls in our form. 

Telling Angular what our form looks like:
In the template-driven approach, we choose which inputs we want to add as contols and add the attribute ngModel.
(This is the same directive we used in two-way databinding - however, here, we'll add it without any parentheses or square brackets.)
In order for this to work and have this input recognized as a control in our form, we need to give Angular another piece of info: the name of this control.
We do this by adding the normal HTML attribute: name
<input
    type="text"
    id="username"
    class="form-control"
    ngModel
    name="username">

Now this control will be registered in the JS representation of the form. 
We set up the select the same way - it's just another type of input. 

# submitting and using the form
We want to actually see what the user entered. 
In the app.component.ts we'll add a method, onSubmit(). This should be triggered whenever the form is submitted by the user. And we'll want to output whatever the user entered.
We first need to call the method. So back in the template, instead of doing a click listener on the button of the form, because the default html behavior would be triggered. And it will also trigger a JS event, the submit event. 
Angular takes advantage of this and gives us a directive we can place on the form element (as a whole). It's called ngSubmit and gives us one event we can listen to.
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">...</form>
This ngSubmit will be fired whenever the form is submitted.

In order to see the values that were submitted, to see the form object.
In the template-driven approach we need to set this up in the template.
In the form object/element we want to get access to the form created by Angular. 

We can place a local reference on the HTML form element: #f and pass f as an argument to the onSubmit method. 
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)" #f>

In the onSubmit method in the TS file, we pass form of type HTMLFormElement, and then we can output the form.
onSubmit(form: HTMLFormElement) {
    console.log(form);
}
